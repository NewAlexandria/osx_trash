# OSX Trash

Ruby class and CLI app for moving files to the OSX Trash

## Summary

The OSX Trash gem will take a filepath containing paths to files that should be moved to the OSX trash.  The list can be a little noisy, with things that will go away with `strip`. When instantiatin the class, you can pass a hash of file: with the pathname, or paths: with an array. }

This gem relies on Applescript (`osax`), which all Apple computers should have.

## Usage

```
OSX.trash file:path_to_file_list
```

When running locally, `send_to_trash` may move files that are in a watched folder, such as by Dropbox or Google Filestream.  These programs may raise a Finder dialog to confirm moving them.  You will have to click "OK" for each one.  This may cause problems on remote / headless systems.  Please file an issue with bug report, or a PR.  Thanks.


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
